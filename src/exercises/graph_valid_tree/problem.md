Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of **undirected** edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.


**Example 1:**

```java
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]

Output: true
```


**Example 2:**

```java
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]]

Output: false
```


**Note:**
* You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are `undirected`, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in edges.


**Constraints:**
* `1 <= n <= 2000`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 5000`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`
* `a_i != b_i`
* There are no self-loops or repeated edges.
