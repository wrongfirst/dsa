Given an integer array `nums`, find a **subarray** that has the largest product, and return the product.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

You can assume the output will fit into a **32-bit** integer.

**Note** that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,4,-3,5]

Output: 8
```

Explanation: `[2,4]` has the largest product `8`.


**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [-3,0,-2]

Output: 0
```

Explanation: The result cannot be `6`, because `[-3,-2]` is not a subarray.


**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 20,000`
* `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
* The product of any subarray of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
