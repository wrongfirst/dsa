Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are *unique*, and two nodes from the tree `p` and `q`, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor between two nodes `p` and `q` is the lowest node in a tree `T` such that both `p` and `q` as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 8

Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 4

Output: 3
```

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 3 and 4 is 3, since a node can be a descendant of itself.


**Constraints:**
* `2 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` will both exist in the BST.
