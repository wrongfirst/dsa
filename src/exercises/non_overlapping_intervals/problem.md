Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note: Intervals are *non-overlapping* even if they have a common point. For example, `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` are overlapping, but `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,4]]

Output: 1
```

Explanation: After [1,4] is removed, the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,4]]

Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= intervals.length <= 100,000`
* `intervals[i].length == 2`
* `-50000 <= starti < endi <= 50000`
